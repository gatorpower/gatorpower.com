## Description

Gatorpower.com is a testament to cutting-edge web development, embodying a mission to leverage a full spectrum of modern technologies for an unparalleled user experience. Our platform is engineered as a showcase of expertise in diverse areas, including the reactive paradigms of LitElement, the structured routing of Vaadin Router, and the rigorous application of TypeScript for scalable, maintainable code. By integrating these technologies with a Rollup-based build system, we ensure efficient delivery and performance. Our commitment extends beyond functionality, emphasizing code quality and best practices with thorough linting, formatting, and testing strategies. Gatorpower.com is not just a web application; it's a confluence of innovation, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of excellence in the web development arena.

## Quickstart

To set up the project:

```sh
npm install
# Ensure you have node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run start
```

This command bundles your application with Rollup in watch mode and serves it with live reloading at `http://localhost:10001`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command bundles your application with Rollup and outputs the files to the `dist` directory.

## Running Tests

To run tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

For continuous testing mode:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

## Linting and Formatting

- **Linting:** To lint your code for any code quality issues:

  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Formatting:** To format your code according to prettier standards:

  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```

## Tooling Configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
