## Description

Gatorpower.com is built with the Lit library for building fast, lightweight web components, and Vaadin Router for client-side routing. It's designed to be modular, performant, and easy to develop with a focus on future web standards.

## Quickstart

To set up the project:

```sh
npm install
# Ensure you have node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Development

To start the development server:

```sh
npm run start
```

This command bundles your application with Rollup in watch mode and serves it with live reloading at `http://localhost:10001`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command bundles your application with Rollup and outputs the files to the `dist` directory.

## Running Tests

To run tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

For continuous testing mode:

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

## Linting and Formatting

- **Linting:** To lint your code for any code quality issues:

  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Formatting:** To format your code according to prettier standards:

  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```

## Tooling Configs

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
